# Checkers_Game

I developed a checkers game using the Java programming language.

- When users start the application, a menu will appear.

- When users select "How to Play," a detailed explanation of the game's rules and mechanics will appear.

- When users select "Play Game," the game board will appear on the screen, displaying the checker pieces.

- Once the game begins, each player can move their pieces according to the rules of the game.

- When a player captures another player's checker piece, it disappears from the board.

- When the players have almost cleared the board, the player with remaining pieces wins the game.
